	<h5>Cocaine</h5>
		<p><b>Cocaine stimulates the reward pathway in the brain.</b>Cocaine (from French: cocaïne, from Spanish: coca, ultimately from Quechua: kúka)[14] is a tropane alkaloid that acts as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.<br><br><br><hr> As an extract, it is mainly used recreationally, and often illegally for its euphoric and rewarding effects. It is also used in medicine by Indigenous South Americans for various purposes and rarely, but more formally as a local anaesthetic by medical practitioners in more developed countries. It is primarily obtained from the leaves of two Coca species native to South America; Erythroxylum coca and E. novogranatense.[15][16] <i>After extraction from the plant, and further processing into cocaine hydrochloride (powdered cocaine), the drug is administered by being either snorted, applied topically to the mouth, or dissolved and injected into a vein. It can also then be turned into free base form (typically crack cocaine), in which it can be heated until sublimated and then the vapours can be inhaled.</i>[12][16] Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, sexual arousal, loss of contact with reality, or agitation.<hr><mark>[12] Physical effects may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and dilated pupils.</mark>[12] High doses can result in high blood pressure or high body temperature.[17] <b>Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes.</b>[12] As cocaine also has numbing and blood vessel constriction properties, it is occasionally used during surgery on the throat or inside of the nose to control pain, bleeding, and vocal cord spasm.[18]</p>
