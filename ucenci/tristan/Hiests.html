	<p>Players must be rank 12 or above to set up a heist, and must own a high-end apartment with a heist planning room. Once the player has reached the necessary level and purchased an appropriate apartment, Lester Crest will contact the player by text and follow up phone call introducing the heists concept. The player must then meet with Lester at his garment factory. This will launch the tutorial heist The Fleeca Job. For the purpose of the tutorial, Lester covers the front money cost and acts as Heist Leader.</p>

	<p>Some missions have all of the players involved working together as one unit, some require players to take on specific tasks like hacking or crowd control, while others require players to split into smaller teams to complete separate objectives concurrently. There are eight heists in GTA Online, each with its own series of setup missions. Unlike regular contact missions, payouts from heists (both setup missions and the heists themselves) are paid directly into the player's bank account, not their pocket as cash.</p>

   <p>After successfully completing the first heist, Lester will introduce a new character who will contact the player directly when a new heist is available. Following this, the player has the option of setting up heists themselves, becoming a Heist Leader. Each heist must be unlocked in order and requires an increasing amount of front money to set up. A proportion of this front money goes towards paying crew members for taking part in the setup missions, although the Heist Leader does not receive any of this money and can profit only from successfully completing the main heist mission itself. The Heist Leader must have the requisite team to carry out the missions, typically consisting of 4 players (with the exception of The Fleeca Job, which requires a crew of just 2 players and also The Doomsday Heist, where a majority of <mark>missions can be completed with 2-4 players)</mark>, and the Heist Leader will not be able to launch these missions with fewer than the number of players required. Likewise, the heist setup/finale will be failed if a crew left.</p>
