<h4>Cocaine</h4>
<p><b>Cocaine</b> <hr>(from<b> French</b>: cocaïne, from <b>Spanish</b>: <mark>coca</mark>, ultimately from Quechua: kúka)<sub>[14] is a <b>tropane alkaloid that acts as a central nervous system</b></sub> (CNS) stimulant. <i>As an extract</i>, it is mainly used recreationally, and often illegally for its euphoric and rewarding effects. It is also used in medicine by Indigenous <b>South Americans</b> for various purposes and rarely, <del>but more formally</del> as a local anaesthetic by medical practitioners in more developed countries. It is primarily obtained from<b> the leaves of two Coca</b> species native to <b>South America</b>; <b>Erythroxylum coca and E. novogranatense</b>.[15][16] After extraction from the plant, and further processing into <b>cocaine hydrochloride</b> (powdered cocaine), the <b>drug</b> is administered by being either snorted, applied topically to the mouth, or dissolved and <b>injected into a vein</b>. <br>It can also then be turned into free base form (typically crack cocaine), in which it can be heated until sublimated and then the vapours can be <b>inhaled</b>.[12]</p>
