<p><br>How to Make Tzatziki Sauce
<br>1.I first started eating tzatziki sauce at Greek restaurants, but I’ve since learned that it’s incredibly easy to whip up at home. Now, along with pesto, it’s one of my must-make summer sauces. Here’s how you do it:

<br>2.Start by grating the cucumber. I use the largest holes on a box grater to give my final sauce texture and plenty of green flecks. 
<br>3.Next, squeeze the water out of the grated cucumber. This step is essential for making a creamy tzatziki – if you skip it, the water from the cucumber will cause your sauce to separate. Squeeze the cucumber directly over the sink, or press it lightly between kitchen or paper towels.
<br>Then, stir everything together! Mix the squeezed cucumber with the yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, salt, and herbs, and chill until you’re ready to use.
That’s it!</p>

<h1>2.Hungary</h1>
		<p><br>1.In a bowl of a stand mixer, combine flour, salt and sugar. Mix with a spoon. <br>Add yeast. Mix again. Add milk and give it a quick mix with a spoon again.
	<br>2.With bread attachment, mix on low speed for a few minutes (about 3-4) or until well combined (see note 4)<br>3.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and clean kitchen towel.
	Let it proof in a warm place until doubled in size (45-60 minutes, see note 5).
	<br>5.When ready, transfer the dough onto a well-floured work top. Divide into 4 equally-looking pieces.
	<br>5.Form a ball out of each piece. <br>Roll out with a rolling pin (about ¼-inch/0.5-centimeters thick and about 7-inch/17-centimeter in diameter).<br>7.In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat oil.<br>8.When hot, add one rolled flatbread in. Fry for about a minute before turning it over (use kitchen tongs) and fry for a further minute.<br>9.Langos should be nice golden brown, but some pale spots are fine.<br>10.Place each fried bread onto a few sheets of paper kitchen towel to get rid of any excess oil.<br>11.Spread each with a mixture of crushed garlic & olive oil.<br>12.Top with sour cream and shredded cheese.<br>13.Enjoy warm!

<h2>3.Italy</h2>
<p><br>1.Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.
<br>2.In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.
<br>3.Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.
<br>4.Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.
<br>5.Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.
<br>6.Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.
<br>7.Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.
<br>8.Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.
<br>9.Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.
<br>10.Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.
<br>11.Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.
<br>12.Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.
<br>13.Add any garnish of your preference.
